Hello, I'm Joshua Bhatti! I'm currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Information Technology (BTech IT). I completed my 12th grade at Govt School Gurdaspur.
I'm passionate about writing songs, singing, and dancing. These creative outlets allow me to express myself and unwind from my technical studies.
In addition to my artistic pursuits, I love staying active by playing cricket and basketball. These sports not only keep me fit but also teach me valuable lessons in teamwork and strategy.
